# Undergraduate ML & Math Stats Projects

This repository contains selected projects from my undergraduate coursework in machine learning and mathematical statistics. Each project includes hands-on work in Python, focused on real-world data, model evaluation, and statistical analysis.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Machine Learning Course Project
- **Topic**: Facial recognition using embeddings and classifiers.
- **What I did**:
  - Collected and aligned custom celebrity face images using MTCNN.
  - Extracted facial embeddings using FaceNet.
  - Trained several classifiers (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) and compared their performance.
  - Visualized misclassifications to diagnose edge cases.
- **Tools**: Python, FaceNet, Scikit-learn, matplotlib

### 2. Math Stats Project
- **Topic**: Testing the independence of log returns in financial markets.
- **What I did**:
  - Analyzed high/medium/low-volume stocks.
  - Applied autocorrelation tests (ACF, Ljungâ€“Box), and stationarity checks (ADF).
  - Built time series visualizations to interpret trading volume impact.
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, statsmodels, seaborn
